# Advanced Prefab Replacer (Unity Editor Tool)

## Overview
This Unity Editor tool allows you to replace prefab instances in your scene quickly and safely.
You can either:
- Use a *custom window* with advanced options (position/rotation/scale preserve, layer, etc.)
- Or use a *right-click context menu* in the Hierarchy for fast single-instance replacement.

No additional packages required. Pure Editor utility.

## Installation

2. Make sure it stays inside Assets/ and the scripts stay under an Editor/ folder.
